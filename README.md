### Ongoing, To be updated

To implement all three models namely LSTM, BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM for short term load forecasting for multivariate data, and to implement the same using bayesian optimisation, apply attention mechanism and compare the results to the results obtained through a traditional grid search method for hyperparameters, as well as to comapre the relative performance of the models for univariate and multivariate data.
